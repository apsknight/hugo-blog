            <p>It’s June, and the mango season. I have just closed the lid of my work laptop after a typical workday. While pondering what to do with the couple of spare hours before dinner, here I am trying to scribble something again on this long forgotten blog feed.</p>
<p>I completed 25 years of life this month and as my <em>me-only</em> solitude whatsapp chatgroup is brimming with my cold shower thoughts journal-<em>ish</em> entries, I am attempting this writing to stitch these thoughts in a blog (<em>after a long break of 2.5 years from my last post</em>) so that I can reflect back on my naivety in the years to come.</p>
<p>The emotions of finally turning 25 first stroke when YJHD celebrated 10 year anniversary on 31st May. I still vividly remember watching that movie around my birthday 10 years ago on a bright summer afternoon. I was at my aunt’s home in Delhi for summer vacations after my 10th standard exams. I along with my cousins went to PVR at East Delhi Mall for one of the afternoon show followed by a visit to majestic Akshardham Temple nearby. A lot of water has flown in Ganges since then. Seeing around, meeting other school folks from that time, I’d say, life and luck has been on the kinder side for me (touchwood). But then, I have always opted to dream conservatively and realistically rather than having huge expectations from life and getting disappointment in vain. Also, what big a first generation small towner from nowhere can dream of in life? Unlike bollywood movies, my dreams were naturally insignificant as would have been of any other typical 15 year old from a similar middle class background, like flying in airplane 4 years later in 2017 for the first time was a dream come true for me as I was the first one in my family to see the clouds from up above. Similarly, doing engineering from an IIT, getting a decent job, buying an iPhone from my own pocket were all a dream once. (<em>Nonetheless, it would be hypocritical to not acknowledge the privilege of having a support system in the life which provided me access to all the resources for exercising whatever I wanted</em>).</p>
<p>Would that 15 year old Aman be proud of me now? Probably yes or maybe no. I don’t know the answer as maybe that was still an young age to think about HR interview question of where do you see yourself 10 years later. But regardless of the answer, I hate growing old. Also, not to mention 25 is a psychologically big number like an inflection point on the graph of life. You can no longer select 18–24 option in the dropdown while filling those online forms. You are no longer considered that shiny eyed teen who is still exploring life but a fully grown adult who is supposed to fulfil growing responsibilities. However, I hope, I’ve gathered enough life learnings over past decade to navigate this coming phase and I hope my faith and luck continues to be supportive as I stroll through the chaotic uncharted ambiguous territories of adulthood.</p>
<p>Again, I don’t have that many big aspirations from the years to come and would be happy with wherever life takes me. However, few non-negotiables from the decade to come is, I hope, I’ll be spending time on fitness and good health habits, and at 35, I’ll be healthiest and fittest as one can be. Also, as it is <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/06/health/losing-friends-mid-twenties/index.html">commonly known fact</a> that social circle starts shrinking after mid twenties. I hope, I’d be able to spend time in meaningful friendships and relationships and will still be in touch with most of my friends at 35.</p>
<p>Signing off with that note..!</p>
