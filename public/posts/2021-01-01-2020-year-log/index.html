            <p>I still remember the night of 31st December 2019. College was scheduled to reopen from 1st January for Spring Semester. I was flying from New Delhi to Bhubaneswar after the winter break. Spent the beginning of new year in air, reached my college’s hostel at around 1:30 AM. Few of floormates were already there and they had big plans for the night. What happened after that is hazy in the memory, the only thing I remember is I woke in evening of 1st Jan and missed the semester registration.</p>
<p>What followed for next 2 and half months was the best time of engineering. All friends were placed, the semester had only 2 major courses and almost every day was an holiday. Most of the time was spent playing cricket, watching every other Netflix series and partying. Everything was going like a dream until that fateful day in mid march. Dean SA mailed notifying suspension of classes for 2 weeks and asking to pack bags. Little did I knew that we were going for good and won’t be seeing the college back for the year. Things unfolded after that were nowhere imaginable the day I left the Bhubaneswar. From online classes to online exams to online convocation, the engineering was complete but still feels incomplete.</p>
<p>Thanks to my employer, I could start my first ever job even in these unprecedented times by working from home. Joined Amazon in mid July and the first 5 months as a Software Engineer were nothing short of what I imagined. Looking back I feel extremely lucky and blessed to start my first job during black swan when most of the folks around the world were being handed pink slips.</p>
<p>Looking back to 2020, the memories are bittersweet. While I’ll always regret what is missed due to pandemic, I am also grateful that I got to spend time with the family for the longest duration since I went to Kota for JEE prep. The only wish for 2021 is that it will again bring the normalcy back in the life and I’ll be able to tick things from my lists that I couldn’t in 2020 due to lockdowns. Signing off with this hope, Happy New Year!</p>
